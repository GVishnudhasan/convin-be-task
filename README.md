# Daily Expenses Sharing Application

A backend service designed to manage and share daily expenses among participants, supporting equal, exact, and percentage-based splits. The application provides user and expense management functionality, input validation, and downloadable balance sheets.

## Objective

This application allows users to add expenses and split them in three different waysâ€”equal, exact, and percentage. It ensures proper data management, input validation, and offers a downloadable balance sheet for detailed financial tracking.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register users with an email, name, and mobile number.
- **Expense Management**: 
  - Split expenses using three methods: Equal, Exact, and Percentage.
  - Add, retrieve, and view individual or overall expenses.
  - Ensure that percentages in the Percentage split method add up to 100% and Exact split method adds upto total amount.
- **Balance Sheet**: 
  - Show individual expenses for each user.
  - Show overall expenses across all users.
  - Downloadable balance sheet for easy financial tracking.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Optimized Queries**: Ensure high performance for retrieving expense details even with large datasets.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and input validation to ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend framework.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling API routes.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user and expense details.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.

- **POST** `/api/users/login` - Login an existing user with email and password.
- **GET** `/api/users/logout` - Logout the current user.
- **GET** `/api/users/:id` - Retrieve user details by user ID.

## Expense Calculation Methods

1. **Equal Split**:
   - Total amount is split equally among all participants.
   - Example: A bill of 3000 is split equally among 3 friends, each paying 1000.
   
2. **Exact Amount**:
   - Specify the exact amount each participant owes.
   - Example: A shopping expense of 4299 is split where Friend 1 owes 799, Friend 2 owes 2000, and you owe 1500.

3. **Percentage Split**:
   - Specify the percentage of the total amount each participant owes.
   - Ensure the percentages add up to 100%.
   - Example: At a party with two friends and a cousin, you owe 50%, Friend 1 owes 25%, and Friend 2 owes 25%.

## Data Validation

- **User Data**: Validate user input fields (email, name, mobile number) during registration and login.
- **Expense Data**: Validate that:
  - The total percentage for the percentage split method adds up to exactly 100%.
  - Correct amounts are provided in the exact split method.
